My journey into web development began when I was googling was that I can make additional income as a side job.
I stumbled across a few articles on web development that caught me interest. From there I began comsuming all the resources I could find on the subject. I took various online courses in order to get an understanding about the subject.

What really drew me to the career of web development was the vast amount of possiblities that it can give an individual.

From day one my interest for web development has been growing and shows no signs of slowing down. I am extremely dedicated and passionate about this career. My ultimate goal is to become a fullstack developer, one who knows both the front end and back on of web technologies.
