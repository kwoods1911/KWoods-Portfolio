HTML AND CSS
HTML AND CSS IS THE BASIC MARKUP LANGUAGE FOR WEBPAGES.
USING THESE BASIC TOOLS I CAN PRODUCE ANY WEBDESIGN PRESENTED TO ME.
WHETHER IT BE A ROUGH SKETCH OR A IMAGE I CAN BRING YOUR IDEA TO LIFE.


JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY
JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY IS USED TO MAKE STATIC WEB PAGES MORE INTERACTIVE.
I HAVE A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF THE TWO LANGUAGES AND I CAN USE BOTH TO IMPORVE THE USER EXPERIENCE ON WEB PAGES.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN.
MODERN WEB PAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE BE RESPONSIVE. I PERSONALLY ENSURE THAT ALL WEBPAGES THAT I BUILD ARE FUNCTIONAL AND ASETHETICALLY PLEASING ON ALL DEVICES.

A DESIRE TO LEARN
I HAVE A STRONG DESIRE TO IMPROVE MY SKILLS AND SUCCEED IN THIS CAREER. WEB DEVELOPMENT IS NOT JUST A JOB FOR ME IT IS A PASSION OF MINE. I LOVE IMPORVING MY SKILLS AND LEARNING ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. MY PASSION AND DEDICATION TO THIS FIELD WILL BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN ME AND MORE SEASONED DEVELOPERS SOONER THAN EXPECTED.
